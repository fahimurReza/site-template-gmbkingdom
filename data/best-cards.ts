    description:
      "A driveway is only as strong as the ground beneath it. Unlike many concrete contractors Frisco homeowners hire, we never pour directly onto native clay. We excavate deeper to install a 4-inch compacted flex-base cushion. This absorptive layer acts as a shock absorber, protecting your slab from the inevitable heaving of the earth.",

    title: "Unmatched Structural Integrity",
    description:
      "We strictly forbid the use of flimsy wire mesh, which often sinks to the bottom of the pour and becomes useless. We exclusively use #3 steel rebar grids (16″ on center) and high-strength 4000 PSI concrete mixes. This ensures your patio, sidewalk, or foundation has the tensile strength required to resist cracking year after year.",

      "We aren’t a generic Dallas crew; we live in 75034. We know the specific architectural requirements of neighborhoods like Starwood, Newman Village, and Stonebriar. We handle the HOA paperwork, ensure compliance with City of Frisco setback rules, and keep your project legal and stress-free.",
